# Mint-A-Cast Farcaster Frame
An ETHGlobalFramework Hackathon Project by Ricy [@ricy](https://warpcast.com/ricy) and Jamie [@chicago](https://warpcast.com/chicago).

## Introduction
We created the Mint-A-Cast frame to empower creators and users. We wanted to solve 2 problems: 
- How do we have on-chain attribution for users who save casts?
- How do we reward creators for quality, popular casts?

Our Mint-A-Cast frame solves these two problems. First, the frame allows users to mint banger casts and allows them to have an on-chain record of casts they like. Creators (cast authors) can set a fee when their casts are minted; this gives creators another avenue of revenue. Creators also have a way to track users who are rewarding them for their content; this gives another directory to content creators to possibly reward their followers. With the Mint-A-Cast frame, users directly reward creators for quality content thus increases the reward for casting quality content.

## MVP Summary
Through the use of this frame, user can input a cast link and complete a transaction to mint the cast as an NFT. This NFT get attributed to the cast creator. Currently, the cast creator can set a minting fee by interacting with the contract directly.
